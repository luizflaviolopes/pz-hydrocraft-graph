##Project Zomboid + Hydrocraft items connections visualization

I'm using Hydrocraft and I was very lost at the beginning. To help me, I developed a visual system to understand the connection between the items and to know better what to look for in the game. I think it can also help the community.

I trying to update all recipes, but has a tons of it. If you see anything outdated or missing, just open an issue or send me an e-mail (luiz.lf.flavio@gmail.com)
